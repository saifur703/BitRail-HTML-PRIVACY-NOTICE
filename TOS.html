          If your BitRail balance becomes negative for any reason, that negative BitRail balance represents an amount

          deduct these amounts from funds that are added to your BitRail account later, either by you or from payments
          you receive. If you have more than one BitRail account, we may set off a negative BitRail balance in one
          BitRail account against a BitRail balance in your other BitRail account(s). If you continue using your BitRail
          account when it has a negative balance, you authorize BitRail to combine the negative balance with any debit
          or transaction sent from your account when that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the

          Our Privacy Policy describes the process of verifying your identity in order to register for and open a

        <ul

          <li style="box-sizing: border-box; list-style: none;">Your identity is verified either via an electronic
            process with your mobile phone carrier or the manual process described in the Privacy Policy;</li>
          <li style="box-sizing: border-box; list-style: none;">Your email address is verified by your responding to the
            introductory message transmitted through the registration process;</li>

          <li style="box-sizing: border-box; list-style: none;">BitRail has received test monies from your designated

          style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(11, 6, 47); font-family: Rubik, sans-serif;">
          Beyond the process of verifying your identity and email address, it is necessary to link one or more Bank
          Accounts to your BitRail Account. This is accomplished by entering your Bank Account number, type of Bank
          Account, bank routing number, and billing address, as part of the registration process. BitRail uses this
          information to deposit one or more small amounts as an ACH transaction into your applicable Bank Account as
          test transactions. You will provide the amounts of these deposits to BitRail in order to verify that you have
          access to the applicable Bank Account, and then BitRail will enter ACH transactions to withdraw the same
          amounts and deposit them in your applicable Vault. Depending on your bank, it may take up to five (5) business
          days for this process to be completed. BitRail is not responsible for delays or errors by Third Party
          Financial Providers, though we will work with you to seek to resolve any issues as may be commercially
          reasonable.</p>

          We ask that you please keep all Bank Account information current. If this information changes and we become
          aware of it, we may update it as directed by your bank without any action on your part.</p>
        <ol

          Once your BitRail Account is open, you must fund the account before you may begin using it for purchases. You
          may either fund the account by using the account as a Payee with another BitRail Authorized User, or you may
          Transfer funds to the BitRail Account from your Bank Account with a Third Party Financial Provider. It may
          take up to three (3) business days to obtain funds from your Bank Account, depending on the speed and actions
          of the bank. You authorize BitRail to try this Transfer again if the initial Transfer is rejected by your bank
          for any reason.</p>

          Once your account has funds in it, you may use the funds to purchase Coins. At this time, FreedomCoins may be
          purchased directly from BitRail by designating a portion of the monies being received from another Authorized
          User or from a Third Party Financial Provider to be received in FreedomCoins.</p>

          Each BitRail Account has one or more Vaults, and you may associate a different Vault Handle with each account.
          For example, it is possible to change a Vault Handle to match the name of your business (although all BitRail
          Accounts are maintained in individual capacity). You may also set the allocation of dollars and Coins that
          Transfers to you are reflected in in each Vault.</p>

          You are responsible for maintaining your account information, as well as adequate security and control of any
          and all IDs, passwords, or any other codes that you use to access your BitRail Account and applicable Vaults.
          You are responsible for keeping your mailing address, email address and other contact information up-to-date
          in your BitRail Account profile. At a minimum, the required identifying information for purposes of a BitRail

          To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your BitRail Account, you should regularly log into your
          BitRail Account and review your BitRail Account statement. You should review any transaction notifications to
          ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed. Please report any unauthorized
          transactions (i.e. unauthorized access to your BitRail Account) to our Support Desk. Please note that if you
          give another person access to your BitRail Account (by giving them your login information) and they use your

          You need a BitRail balance to send money or buy something using your BitRail Account. If your BitRail Account
          is open as described in Section I(a) above, you will need to fund the account as described in Section I(b)
          above. Thereafter, you may make a Transfer to another Authorized User of BitRail. When you use your BitRail
          Account as a payment method, you are allowing BitRail to initiate an ACH Transfer from your BitRail Account to
          the Payee. For these transactions, BitRail will make electronic Transfers via ACH from your BitRail Account in
          the amount you specify.</p>

          Money that you receive from other BitRail Authorized Users will be held as a balance in your BitRail Account.

          You can buy something from a Payee who accepts BitRail using the funds in your BitRail Vault. When you
          authorize a payment to a Payee who accepts BitRail, some Payees may take up to 30 days to complete the
          transaction. In these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your BitRail Account. In that
          case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the Payee completes the transaction (but no
          longer than 30 days).</p>

          If you have a BitRail balance, you may withdraw it by transferring it to the Bank Account linked to your
          BitRail Vault. We may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that the
          withdrawal has been authorized by you or if other payments to your BitRail Account have been reversed (for
          example, as a result of a bank reversal or limitation on your BitRail Account while a withdrawal from your
          BitRail Account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation has been lifted. We
          may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view your withdrawal limit, if any, by logging into your
          BitRail Account. To help us verify your BitRail Account, you may be asked to verify your Bank Account

          Should you choose to close your BitRail Account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete Transfers where

          (e.g. to your linked Bank Account). You will remain liable for all obligations related to your BitRail Account
          even after the BitRail Account is closed. We may refuse to allow closure of a BitRail Account where: (a) you

          negative balance; (c) we believe you may be seeking to evade an investigation, whether by us, by a Third Party

          BitRail Balances are NOT FDIC-Insured. Any BitRail balance you hold represents an unsecured claim and, except

          will own the interest or other earnings on these investments. However, the claim against us represented by

          If you do not log in to your BitRail Account for a period of one (1) year, we may close your BitRail Account
          and send the BitRail balance to your Bank Account. Where the Bank Account is no longer functional, where
          required by law, we may use reasonable efforts to contact you or escheat (send) your BitRail balance to your
          state of residency. If your address is unknown or registered in a foreign country, your BitRail balance will
          be escheated to the State of Georgia. Where required, we will send you a notice prior to escheating any funds

          When we identify a potentially high-risk Transfer or other transaction, we review the Transfer more closely

          the hold. As a Payor, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased. If we clear the transaction, we
          will notify the Payee. If we don&rsquo;t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you.

          Unless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described below, we will notify you of our actions, but
          we retain the sole discretion to take these actions. Our decisions may be based on proprietary policies that
          we use to manage risk on our systems. We may use confidential anti-fraud and risk modeling policies and
          procedures when assessing the risk associated with your BitRail Account. In addition, we may be restricted by
          regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions. We

          A hold is a temporary stop that BitRail may impose under certain circumstances, at any level including the
          BitRail Account, Vault or Transfer level. When BitRail places a temporary hold on a Transfer, the money is not
          available to you as the BitRail Account owner, whether you are Payor or Payee. Our decision to place a hold
          may arise from many factors including account history, transaction activity, past disputes or other factors
          that we know about, or information we obtain from third parties. We may place a hold on a Transfer to you as
          Payee if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your
          BitRail Account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal
          regulatory requirements.</p>

          When we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your BitRail Account with an indication that they
          are unavailable or pending. We&rsquo;ll notify you, either through your BitRail Account or directly by phone
          or email, whenever we place a hold. Risk-based holds can remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the
          Transfer was received into your BitRail Account. We may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances
          (for example, if you&rsquo;ve uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any
          earlier release is at our sole discretion. The hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is challenged
          as a Transfer that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction. In this case,
          we&rsquo;ll hold the payment in your BitRail Account until the matter is resolved (but no longer than 180
          days).</p>

          We may place limits on your BitRail Account that prevent you from taking certain actions, such as withdrawing,
          sending or receiving money. These limitations are implemented to help protect our Payors and Payees when
          we&nbsp;notice restricted activities or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious. Limits also help
          us collect information necessary for keeping your BitRail Account open.</p>

          <li style="box-sizing: border-box; list-style: none;">If your bank lets us know that there have been
            unauthorized transfers between your BitRail Account and your Bank Account.</li>

          To remove the limitation and restore your BitRail Account, you will need to resolve any issues with the
          account, often by providing information to us, as applicable.</p>

          If you receive a Transfer for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason
          (e.g. you do not fulfill the transaction as promised or cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery
          when required, ACH return, payment sent to you in error, payment violated these terms of use), you
          are&nbsp;responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you, plus any applicable fees. Whenever a
          transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, we will refund or reverse the transaction from your BitRail
          Account in the same manner as the original transaction (i.e., dollars and/or Coins). If you refund a payment
          for good or services, we will retain the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid as the Payee. The
          buyer&rsquo;s account will be credited with the full payment amount and the fixed fee portion of the fees you
          paid as the Payee will be deducted from your BitRail Account in addition to the amount of the refunded
          payment.</p>

          When you receive a Transfer, you are liable to BitRail for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any
          fees if the Transfer is later invalidated, in whole or in part, for any reason. If your BitRail balance is
          insufficient to cover your liability for the payment amount plus the fees, then this will result in a negative
          BitRail balance. Any negative BitRail balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation,
          you must immediately add funds to your BitRail balance to eliminate the negative BitRail balance. If you do
          not do so, BitRail may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you and/or place a limitation
          or hold on your BitRail Account.</p>

          after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no Error, we will send you a written
          explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation. If we decide that
          there has been an Error, we will credit the account and otherwise work to correct such Error, including any

          You may opt out of the Rewards Program at any time by discontinuing your use of FreedomCoins..</p>

          The benefits that are available to you through the Rewards Program are based on the number of Rewards Points
          that you earn by making qualifying purchases on GunBroker.com or other websites that may in the future accept
          purchases using FreedomCoins, or by participating in other BitRail Rewards Program promotional activities as
          may be offered from time to time. Qualifying purchases on such sites include purchases made through the use of
          BitRail FreedomCoins, as well as purchases made using ACH or other forms of payment on such sites. In order to
          receive Rewards Points for a purchase, your order must be placed within the BitRail Account that is associated
          with your Rewards Program account. You may have one Rewards Program account only and your Rewards Points are
          not transferable. You are responsible for anyone else who uses your Rewards Program account. You will earn
          Rewards Points based on the total amount paid for your qualifying purchases, excluding any purchases made
          using other discount codes or gift cards. Rewards Points may not be earned by paying fees. Rewards Points will
          only be earned following the final settlement of the applicable transaction &ndash; i.e., after the
          appropriate funds have been debited from your BitRail Account or your Bank Account as applicable and after the
          expiration of any Hold (as those terms are defined in the User Agreement). It may take several days following
          the final settlement of the applicable transaction before the Rewards Points appear in your account.</p>
        <p dir="ltr"
          style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(11, 6, 47); font-family: Rubik, sans-serif;">
          Rewards Points may be earned and redeemed based on a percentage of the total amount of qualifying purchases
          made using your BitRail Account. The amount of Rewards Points earned may vary depending on the Rewards Program
          tier (&ldquo;Tier&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tiers&rdquo;) that you qualify for at the time of the purchase (e.g.,
          Rewards, Gold, Platinum, or Diamond), as further described below. The conversion ratios and Rewards Points
          levels associated with each Tier are subject to change and are available at&nbsp;<a

          The total number of Rewards Points that you can earn in any calendar year may be capped by BitRail in its sole
          discretion with or without notice to you.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr"
          style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(11, 6, 47); font-family: Rubik, sans-serif;">

          The Rewards Program offers different benefits based on the different Rewards Point levels associated with each
          Tier. Your Tier status is determined by the number of Rewards Points that you accumulate in your Rewards
          Program account during each calendar year&nbsp;(&ldquo;Rewards Year&rdquo;). Tiers are based on the total
          Rewards Points earned during the applicable Rewards Year, not the total Rewards Points remaining after
          redemption. In addition, once you reach a specific Tier, your Tier status continues in effect for a period of
          twelve (12) months from the date you reach a specific Tier, even if you redeem your Rewards Points. Specific
          Tier benefits are only available to you while you are in the applicable Tier and cannot be applied
          retroactively.&nbsp;In the event that you move down in Tier levels, you will lose the benefits from the higher
          Tier.</p>

          You can redeem Rewards Points posted to your Rewards Program account through the purchase of FreedomCoins,
          which can be applied toward future transactions on GunBroker.com or other websites that utilize
          BitRail&rsquo;s FreedomCoins. You can redeem your Rewards Points for FreedomCoins by logging into your BitRail
          Account and accessing the Rewards Program page. For additional information on redeeming Rewards Points for

          Rewards Points accumulated under the Rewards Program are promotional in nature and have no cash value. Rewards
          Points are redeemable only for FreedomCoins and cannot be redeemed for cash or applied to previous purchases.
          Your Rewards Points are personal to you and may not be sold, transferred (by operation of law or otherwise) or
          assigned to or shared with family, friends or others, or used by you for any commercial purpose. You are
          responsible for any federal, state or local taxes applicable to your participation in the Rewards Program.</p>

          Without notice to you, BitRail reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Rewards Program account and/or
          your participation in the Rewards Program (in whole or in part), if BitRail determines in its sole discretion
          that you have violated these Rewards Terms, you have more than one Rewards Program account, or that the use of
          your Rewards Program account or your participation in the Rewards Program is unauthorized, abusive, deceptive,
          fraudulent or unlawful for any reason. BitRail may, in its sole discretion, suspend, cancel or combine Rewards
          Program accounts that appear to be duplicative. In the event that your participation in the Rewards Program is
          terminated, you will not be able to redeem any accumulated Rewards Points</p>

          Without notice to you, BitRail also reserves the right to &ldquo;unregister&quot; a Rewards Program account
          that is inactive and cause that Rewards Program account to be ineligible for the Rewards Program. An inactive
          Rewards Program account is defined as a Rewards Program account that has not earned Rewards Points for one
          year. In the event that your Rewards Program account is unregistered due to inactivity, then you will no
          longer be eligible for Rewards Program benefits, including accumulating Rewards Points or redeeming your
          Rewards Points for FreedomCoins. You may reactivate your Rewards Program account by logging into your BitRail
          account or making a purchase using your BitRail account that is associated with your Rewards Program account,
          but any Rewards Points earned prior to the Rewards Program account being deemed inactive will be voided.</p>
